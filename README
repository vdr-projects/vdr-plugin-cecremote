Description:
==============

Plugin to receive and send commands via CEC.

Installation:
==============

First get connected device either via the cec-client if the plugin is not 
running :
     echo "scan" | cec-client -s -d 1

The output should look like:
    opening a connection to the CEC adapter...
    requesting CEC bus information ...

In the plugin configuration directory create the file cecremote.xml (an example
can be found in the contrib directory) with an device entry for each device
which should be handled by this plugin.

In this example device#8 (osd string=CECTester) is the address of the libCEC
device (VDR).

After the first start of the vdr ensure, that the CEC device is not accessed
by the Modem-Manager or mtp-probe by grep for the device path 
(/sys/devices/pci00 ...) in the log.

An example udev rule which can be installed at /etc/udev/rules.d/20-libcec.rules
can be found in the contrib directory. This udev rule disables access of the
ModemManger or mtp-probe to the pulse-eight CEC adapter.

Format of the configuration file :
===================================

The configuration file is in XML format The root element is <config>. Within
this element one <global> child element is used to specify global options
for this plugin and several <menu>, <ceckeymap> and <vdrkeymap> child elements.

* Ceckeymap
====================================
This element contains definitions for mapping a CEC Key to one or more VDR keys.
The <ceckeymap> tag must have the attribute "id" specified. This id is used 
later in the <player> section to address this key map.

This tag creates a new key map with a preconfigured map. Elements of this map
can be overwritten with <key> elements.

* Vdrkeymap
====================================
This element contains definitions for mapping a VDR Key to one or more CEC keys.
The <vdrkeymap> tag must have the attribute "id" specified. This id is used 
later in the <player> section to address this key map.

This tag creates a new key map with a preconfigured map. Elements of this map
can be overwritten with <key> elements.

* Key
====================================
This element is used within <ceckeymap> or <vdrkeymap> to overwrite existing
map entries. The <key> tag must have the attribute "code" specified. This
specifies the key code to redefine. If used in <ceckeymap> code
is a CEC key name (see svdrpsend plug cecremote LSTK for the name of the
supported CEC key codes). When used in <vdrkeymap> the code is the vdr 
key name as used for example in keymacros.conf.

The <key> element can have <value> elements which specifies the key codes
to map. If no <value> element is specified, this key code is not mapped and
so this key is not usable.

* Value
====================================
This element is used within <key> to assign key codes to the key map.

If the <value> element is used in <vdrkeymap> the <value> element contains
a CEC key name (see svdrpsend plug cecremote LSTK for the name of the
supported CEC key codes). When used in <ceckeymap> the <value> element is the 
vdr key name as used for example in keymacros.conf.

The following example create a new key map with id "TV" where the VDR key OK
is mapped the the CEC "ROOT_MENU" key:

  <vdrkeymap id="TV">
    <key code="OK">
      <value>ROOT_MENU</value>
    </key>
  </vdrkeymap>

The next example creates an other key map with id "TV". If the CEC key code
"SELECT" is received, this key is mapped to the VDR menu key. The key code
"RIGHT_UP" is mapped to only "right" and not as default to right+up.

  <ceckeymap id="TV">
    <key code="SELECT">
      <value>Menu</value>
    </key>
    <key code="RIGHT_UP">
      <value>Right</value>
    </key>
  </ceckeymap>


* device
====================================
The device element contains definitions for CEC devices. The main purpose is
to specify a CEC device by the physical address, e.g. when more than one
recording device may be available.

The following configuration would create an entry for a blueray player. 
<device id="blueray">
   <physical>2000</physical>
   <logical>8</logical>
</device>

The software first tries to get the logical address by the device located at
the physical address 2000 (second HDMI port connected to the TV, for the
address concept see for example 
http://elinux.org/CEC_%28Consumer_Electronics_Control%29_over_HDMI ).

In case that there is more than one device available at the physical address or
no device could be found on the physical address the logical address (in this
case Playback 2) is used.

* Global
====================================

The child elements of <global> are <rtcdetect>, <cecdebug>, <onstart>,
<onmanualstart>, <onstop> <onswitchtotv>, <onswitchtoradio>, <onswitchtoreplay>
<shutdownonstandby>, <poweroffonstandby> and <keymaps>.

<cecdebug>          Debug level for CEC debugging (see cec_log_level in cectypes.h)
<onstart>           A command list which is executed upon plugin start.
<onmanualstart>     A command list which is executed upon manual plugin start, but 
                    not if the VDR was started due to a timer.
<onstop>            A command list which is executed upon plugin shutdown.
<onswitchtotv>      A command list which is executed if switched to a TV program.
<onswitchtoradio>   A command list which is executed if switched to a radio program.
<onswitchtoreplay>  A command list which is executed if the VDR replays a recording.
<keymaps>           The <keymaps> tag has the attribute cec, which addresses the 
                    id specified within a <ceckeymap>. This keymap is used to 
                    convert a CEC-Keycode to a VDR-Key.
<cecdevicetype>     The device types to register with libCEC. The following 
                    device types are available:
                    * RECORDING_DEVICE
                    * TUNER
                    * TV
                    * PLAYBACK_DEVICE
                    * AUDIO_SYSTEM
<hdmiport>          Specify the HDMI-Port where the adapter is connected to.
<rtcdetect>         If set to true (default) use the rtc driver to detect if
                    the vdr was started manually or by rtc alarm. Otherwise
                    use a heuristic. If the VDR was started in a time range
                    5 minutes before or after an timer was running, the VDR
                    start is detected as timed start.
<shutdownonstandby> If set to true, all CEC devices are set to standby when the
                    VDR is shut down. Default is false.
<poweroffonstandby> If set to true, all CEC devices are set to power off when
                    the VDR is shut down. Default is false.

NOTE: There seems to be a bug in the libCEC implementation for the Raspberry PI
      which causes a crash when registering more than one device type.

For the description of a command list see below.

* Menu
====================================

Defines a menu for executing CEC and shell commands.

The <menu> tag must have the following attributes:
  * name    : The name of the menu (displayed in the OSD)
  * address : CEC device address.
  
The child elements of <menu> are <onstart>, <onstop>, <player>,
<onpoweron>, <onpoweroff>. <onstart>, <onstop> and <onpoweron>, <onpoweroff> 
are mutually exclusive.

<player>    : (see below).
              
<onstart>   : A command list which is executed when the menu entry is selected.
<onstop>    : A command list which is executed if <stillpic> is present and 
              the player is stopped.
<onpoweron> : A command list which is executed if the device is currently 
              powered off.
<onpoweroff>: A command list which is executed if the device is currently 
              powered on.

* OnCECCommand
====================================

Perform actions when a cec command is received. 

The <onceccommand> must have the following attributes:
  * command :   A CEC opcode as string as defined in cectypes.h, but without the
                CEC_OPCODE_ prefix. The opcode can also be defined as a numeric or
                hex value. The following examples are valid defines for
                CEC_OPCODE_STANDBY:
              
                command="STANDBY", command="0x36", command="54"
  * initiator : The device which initiated this command.
  
The child elements of <onceccommand> are <stopmenu>, <execmenu> and
<commandlist>.

<stopmenu>menu name</stopmenu>:
    If a menu with the name has a still pic player, this player is stopped.
<execmenu>menu name</execmenu>:
    Execute the CEC plugin menu entry with the name.
<commandlist>:
   A command list which is executed when this command is received.

* Player 
====================================
Starts a stillpic player and waits until the player is stopped. This tag can 
not be used with <onpoweron> and <onpoweroff>.

The <player> tag must have the following attribute:
  * file : Filename of the still-picture in mpeg format.
  
The child elements of <player> are <stop>.and <keymaps> 

<stop>    : Can be used several times and contains a VDR-Key to stop this player.
<keymaps> : The <keymaps> tag has the attributes "cec" and "vdr" which
            addresses the id specified within <ceckeymap> or <vdrkeymap>.
            When the player is started, these keymaps are activated. If a tag is
            missing, the default keymap is used. 

* Command lists
====================================

A command list defines a list of actions to be executed.

The child elements of a command list are <poweron>, <poweroff>, <makeactive>
and <exec>.

<poweron>CEC Device Address</poweron>       : Powers the device on.
<poweroff>CEC Device Address</poweroff>     : Powers the device off.
<makeactive/>                               : Makes the VDR the active device.
<makeinactive/>                             : Remove the VDR as the active device.
<textviewon>CEC Device Address</textviewon> : Send the TextViewOn CEC command to
                                              the CEC device.
<exec>Command</exec>                        : Executes a shell command.


* SVDRP Commands
=====================================
LSTK     : List all supported CEC keycodes
LSTD     : List active CEC devices
KEYM     : List available key maps
VDRK [id]: Display the VDR->CEC key map with the given id
CECK [id]: Display the CEC->VDR key map with the given id
CONN     : Connect the CEC adapter.
DISC     : Disconnect the CEC adapter. This can be used for example,
           if an other program requires access to the CEC adapter.

* Commandline arguments
=====================================
-c  --configdir <dir>   : Directory for the configuration file. If the directory
                          does not start with a slash, the directory is relative
                          to the vdr config directory, otherwise it specifies an
                          absolute path. Default is cecremote.
-x  --configfile <file> : Name of the configuartion file. Default is cecremote.xml
