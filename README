Description:
==============

Plugin to receive and send commands via CEC.

Installation:
==============

First get connected device either via the cec-client if the plugin is not 
running :
     echo "scan" | cec-client -s -d 1

The output should look like:
    opening a connection to the CEC adapter...
    requesting CEC bus information ...

On a running VDR with the cecremote plugin running, this information can
be retrieved via:
   svdrpsend plug cecremote LSTD

The output should look like:

In the plugin configuration directory create the file cecremote.xml (an example 
can be found in the contrib directory) with an device entry for each device 
which should be handled by this plugin. 

In this example device#8 (osd string=CECTester) is the address of the libCEC 
device (VDR).

Format of the configuration file :
===================================

The configuration file is in XML format The root element is <config>. Within
this element one <global> child element is used to specify global options
for this plugin and several <menu>, <ceckeymap> and <vdrkeymap> child elements.

* Ceckeymap
====================================
This element contains definitions for mapping a CEC Key to one or more VDR keys.
The <ceckeymap> tag must have the attribute "id" specified. This id is used 
later in the <player> section to address this key map.

This tag creates a new key map with a preconfigured map. Elements of this map
can be overwritten with <key> elements.

* Vdrkeymap
====================================
This element contains definitions for mapping a VDR Key to one or more CEC keys.
The <vdrkeymap> tag must have the attribute "id" specified. This id is used 
later in the <player> section to address this key map.

This tag creates a new key map with a preconfigured map. Elements of this map
can be overwritten with <key> elements.

* Key
====================================
This element is used within <ceckeymap> or <vdrkeymap> to overwrite existing
map entries. The <key> tag must have the attribute "code" specified. This
specifies the key code to redefine. If used in <ceckeymap> code
is a CEC key name (see svdrpsend plug cecremote LSTK for the name of the
supported CEC key codes). When used in <vdrkeymap> the code is the vdr 
key name as used for example in keymacros.conf.

The <key> element can have <value> elements which specifies the key codes
to map. If no <value> element is specified, this key code is not mapped and
so this key is not usable.

* Value
====================================
This element is used within <key> to assign key codes to the key map.

If the <value> element is used in <vdrkeymap> the <value> element contains
a CEC key name (see svdrpsend plug cecremote LSTK for the name of the
supported CEC key codes). When used in <ceckeymap> the <value> element is the 
vdr key name as used for example in keymacros.conf.

The following example create a new key map with id "TV" where the VDR key OK
is mapped the the CEC "ROOT_MENU" key:

  <vdrkeymap id="TV">
    <key code="OK">
      <value>ROOT_MENU</value>
    </key>
  </vdrkeymap>

The next example creates an other key map with id "TV". If the CEC key code
"SELECT" is received, this key is mapped to the VDR menu key. The key code
"RIGHT_UP" is mapped to only "right" and not as default to right+up.

  <ceckeymap id="TV">
    <key code="SELECT">
      <value>Menu</value>
    </key>
    <key code="RIGHT_UP">
      <value>Right</value>
    </key>
  </ceckeymap>


* Global
====================================

The child elements of <global> are <cecdebug>, <onstart> and <onstop>.

<cecdebug> : Debug level for CEC dbugging (see cec_log_level in cectypes.h)
<onstart>  : A command list which is executed upon plugin start.
<onstop>   : A command list which is executed upon plugin shutdown.

For the desciption of a command list see below.

* Menu
====================================

Defines a menu for executing CEC and shell commands.

The <menu> tag must have the following attributes:
  name    : The name of the menu (displayed in the OSD)
  address : CEC device address.
  
The child elements of <menu> are <onstart>, <onstop>, <player>,
<onpoweron>, <onpoweroff>. <onstart>, <onstop> and <onpoweron>, <onpoweroff> 
are mutually exclusive.

<player>    : (see below).
              
<onstart>   : A command list which is executed when the menu entry is selected.
<onstop>    : A command list which is executed if <stillpic> is present and 
              the player is stopped.
<onpoweron> : A command list which is executed if the device is currently 
              powered off.
<onpoweroff>: A command list which is executed if the device is currently 
              powered on.

* Player 
====================================
Starts a stillpic player and waits until the player is stopped. This tag can 
not be used with <onpoweron> and <onpoweroff>.

The <player> tag must have the following attribute:
  file : Filename of the still-picture in mpeg format.
  
The child elements of <player> are <stop>.and <keymaps> 

<stop>    : Can be used several times and contains a VDR-Key to stop this player.
<keymaps> : The <keymaps> tag has the attributes "cec" and "vdr" which
            addresses the id specified within <ceckeymap> or <vdrkeymap>.
            When the player is started, these keymaps are activated. If a tag is
            missing, the default keymap is used. 

* Command lists
====================================

A command list defines a list of actions to be executed.

The child elements of a command list are <poweron>, <poweroff>, <makeactive>
and <exec>.

<poweron>CEC Device Address</poweron>       : Powers the device on.
<poweroff>CEC Device Address</poweroff>     : Powers the device off.
<makeactive/>                               : Makes the VDR the active device.
<makeinactive/>                             : Remove the VDR as the active device.
<textviewon>CEC Device Address</textviewon> : Send the TextViewOn CEC command to
                                              the CEC device.
<exec>Command</exec>                        : Executes a shell command.


* SVDRP Commands
=====================================
LSTK     : List all supported CEC keycodes
LSTD     : List active CEC devices
KEYM     : List available key maps
VDRK [id]: Display the VDR->CEC key map with the given id
CECK [id]: Display the CEC->VDR key map with the given id
